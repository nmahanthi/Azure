**Network Security Groups (NSG)** and **Azure Firewall** are both essential components for securing your Azure network.
While they share similarities, they are designed for different purposes and provide different levels of security and control.
Below is a detailed comparison between **NSGs** and **Azure Firewall** to help clarify their use cases, features, and how they can complement each other.

### 1. **Purpose and Scope**

- **NSG (Network Security Group)**:
  - **Scope**: NSG is used to control **inbound and outbound traffic** at the **network interface**, **VM**, or **subnet level** within a Virtual Network (VNet).
  - **Purpose**: It acts as a **distributed, layer 3 and 4 firewall** within a VNet.
               NSG primarily focuses on controlling traffic flow between Azure resources or between Azure resources and the internet by defining **allow/deny** rules for TCP/UDP traffic.
  - **Granularity**: Rules are applied at the subnet or individual resource level, which allows for granular control over traffic flow.
  - **Primary Use Case**: Used for controlling access between VMs or services within the same VNet, or restricting internet traffic.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - **Scope**: Azure Firewall is a **stateful, centralized network security service** that applies rules at a **VNet level** and can span across multiple VNets and subscriptions.
  - **Purpose**: It is designed to offer **comprehensive, centralized network protection** by controlling both **inbound and outbound traffic**, 
               providing advanced features like URL filtering, threat intelligence, and network/application layer filtering (layer 3, 4, and 7).
  - **Granularity**: Azure Firewall applies rules at a broader scope and is ideal for scenarios where you need **more complex filtering** across entire environments or multiple VNets.
  - **Primary Use Case**: Used for protecting and controlling traffic across VNets, between on-premises and cloud, or for hybrid cloud security.

### 2. **Type of Filtering**

- **NSG**:
  - NSGs operate at **Layer 3 (Network)** and **Layer 4 (Transport)** of the OSI model.
  - It filters traffic based on:
    - **Source and destination IP address**.
    - **Source and destination port**.
    - **Protocol** (TCP/UDP/ICMP).
  - **Stateless** filtering: Each direction of traffic (inbound and outbound) is handled separately, meaning you need to explicitly define rules for both.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - Azure Firewall provides **stateful filtering** (Layer 3, 4, and 7), meaning it can inspect and monitor connections and traffic flow across the network session.
  - It filters traffic based on:
    - **Source and destination IP address**.
    - **Source and destination port**.
    - **Protocol** (TCP/UDP).
    - **FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names)** for outbound traffic.
    - **Application rules** based on HTTP/S and URL filtering.
  - Supports **deep packet inspection** for identifying and filtering application-level traffic, such as allowing/denying access to specific URLs.

### 3. **Stateful vs. Stateless**

- **NSG**:
  - **Stateless** filtering: NSGs evaluate inbound and outbound traffic independently. This means that if you allow inbound traffic, you also need to explicitly configure outbound rules if a response is needed.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - **Stateful** filtering: Azure Firewall keeps track of active connections, so if inbound traffic is allowed, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically permitted without the need for additional rules. 
           This simplifies rule management and improves security.

### 4. **Advanced Security Features**

- **NSG**:
  - NSGs provide basic traffic filtering based on IP, port, and protocol.
  - **No threat intelligence** or advanced threat detection features.
  - Does not support **URL filtering** or **deep packet inspection**.
  - Ideal for controlling internal traffic flows and limiting external access to resources within a VNet.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - **Threat Intelligence**: Azure Firewall integrates with Azure's **Threat Intelligence** service to alert and block traffic from known malicious IPs and domains.
  - **Application Layer Filtering**: Supports **Layer 7 filtering**, enabling you to control outbound access based on URLs and domains (FQDN filtering).
  - **SSL Termination** and **deep packet inspection**: Azure Firewall can inspect encrypted traffic by terminating SSL and applying filtering rules.
  - **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Supports inbound and outbound NAT, making it easier to manage external access.
  - **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides detailed logging of all network traffic and security events via **Azure Monitor** and **Azure Security Center**.

### 5. **Integration with Other Services**

- **NSG**:
  - NSGs can be used in conjunction with other Azure security services such as:
    - **Azure Bastion** for secure RDP/SSH connections.
    - **Application Security Groups (ASGs)** for grouping VMs or NICs into logical application groups and applying NSG rules to these groups.
  - Limited in terms of advanced integration for URL filtering or threat intelligence.
  - Works well when combined with **User Defined Routes (UDRs)** to direct traffic to network appliances for deeper inspection.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - **Highly integrated** with other Azure services:
    - Works well in a **Hub-Spoke** architecture where traffic flows from multiple spoke VNets through a central hub containing Azure Firewall.
    - Can be used with **VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute** for secure connections between on-premises networks and Azure.
    - Works alongside **Azure DDoS Protection** to provide complete traffic filtering and security.
  - Supports **Forced Tunneling** to route traffic through a third-party security appliance or on-premises firewalls.

### 6. **Performance and Scalability**

- **NSG**:
  - NSGs are distributed, meaning they are applied directly at the NIC or subnet level, providing **low-latency filtering** for traffic that doesn't need deep inspection or central control.
  - Scalability is based on the number of NSG rules (default limit is 1000 rules per NSG).

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - Azure Firewall is a **highly scalable** and **centralized** service, designed to handle large amounts of traffic with **auto-scaling** capabilities.
  - It is suited for enterprise-level deployments with the ability to scale automatically to meet traffic demands.

### 7. **Cost**

- **NSG**:
  - **Free**: NSGs come at no additional cost since they are a built-in feature of Azure VNets.
  - Minimal operational overhead because it focuses on basic traffic filtering.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - **Paid Service**: Azure Firewall incurs costs based on deployment size, traffic processed, and rules applied.
  - Costs can increase with heavy traffic or extensive use of application rules, but it offers a richer feature set for enterprise-grade security.

### 8. **Best Use Cases**

- **NSG**:
  - Best suited for **internal traffic control** between Azure resources within a VNet or between VNets.
  - Ideal for **simple filtering** needs, such as limiting access to specific IP addresses or ports.
  - Works well for **small to medium-sized deployments** that don't require centralized traffic control or complex rule sets.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - Best suited for **enterprise environments** with a need for **centralized security** across multiple VNets and subscriptions.
  - Ideal for scenarios where **advanced security** features are required, such as URL filtering, application-layer control, and threat intelligence integration.
  - Fits well in **hybrid cloud** setups where traffic between on-premises and Azure needs to be securely controlled.

### When to Use NSG vs Azure Firewall

- **Use NSG**:
  - For **internal, basic traffic control** within a VNet or between subnets.
  - When you need to apply **granular security** to specific resources or subnets, such as allowing traffic from specific IPs or protocols.
  - For **small-scale applications** where you donâ€™t need advanced threat detection or deep inspection.

- **Use Azure Firewall**:
  - For **enterprise-level security** across multiple VNets and subscriptions, particularly in **hub-spoke architectures**.
  - When you need **advanced security features**, including **stateful filtering**, **URL filtering**, **threat intelligence**, or **application-level rules**.
  - To **centrally control and log** all traffic entering or leaving the network, especially for compliance or security monitoring purposes.

### Conclusion

In summary:
- **NSG** is lightweight and ideal for controlling traffic at a **granular level** within a VNet, focusing on IP and port-based filtering.
- **Azure Firewall** provides **centralized, enterprise-grade protection** with advanced features like **Layer 7 filtering**, **URL filtering**, and **threat intelligence**. 
       It is more suited for complex network security requirements across multiple environments.

In many cases, **NSG and Azure Firewall can complement each other**: NSGs can manage traffic within the VNet, while Azure Firewall provides centralized control and advanced filtering for traffic entering or leaving the VNet.
