A real-time corporate DevOps flow in Azure typically involves a well-structured CI/CD pipeline that integrates Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration, Ansible for configuration management, Jenkins for automation, and SonarQube and Nexus for quality assurance and artifact management. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how each tool fits into the flow:

### 1. **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**
   - **Objective**: Define and provision infrastructure using Terraform scripts to maintain consistency and automate environment setup.
   - **Process**: 
     - Create Terraform scripts to define Azure resources such as virtual networks, AKS clusters, load balancers, and storage.
     - Version control the scripts using Git, allowing teams to track changes.
     - Execute Terraform scripts through a pipeline in Jenkins to automate infrastructure provisioning.
     - Apply Terraform configurations to create or update resources in Azure.

   **Example Terraform Resources**:
   ```hcl
   provider "azurerm" {
     features {}
   }

   resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "aks" {
     name                = "myAKSCluster"
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
     dns_prefix          = "aks"
     default_node_pool {
       name       = "default"
       node_count = 2
       vm_size    = "Standard_DS2_v2"
     }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Ansible for Configuration Management**
   - **Objective**: Configure servers, applications, and manage deployments with Ansible to ensure the required environment setup on AKS or other Azure resources.
   - **Process**:
     - Use Ansible playbooks to manage configuration across AKS nodes or any required VMs.
     - Automate the installation of dependencies, software patches, and security configurations.
     - Trigger Ansible from Jenkins pipelines post-Terraform provisioning to configure the environment.

   **Example Ansible Playbook**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Configure Kubernetes Nodes
     hosts: kubernetes-nodes
     tasks:
       - name: Install required packages
         apt:
           name: "{{ item }}"
           state: present
         with_items:
           - docker
           - kubelet
           - kubectl
   ```

### 3. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for Container Orchestration**
   - **Objective**: Run containerized applications using AKS, ensuring scalability and high availability.
   - **Process**:
     - Deploy microservices or applications as Docker containers into AKS using Helm charts or YAML files.
     - Manage AKS cluster scaling, service discovery, and load balancing automatically.
     - Integrate CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy containers into AKS.

   **Example Deployment in AKS**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: my-app
             image: my-app:latest
             ports:
               - containerPort: 80
   ```

### 4. **Jenkins for CI/CD Automation**
   - **Objective**: Orchestrate the build, test, and deployment processes in an automated manner.
   - **Process**:
     - Jenkins pulls the code from a Git repository.
     - It triggers a build using tools like Maven, npm, or Gradle, depending on the application type.
     - Jenkins can invoke Terraform to provision infrastructure and Ansible for configuration management.
     - Use Jenkins pipelines to deploy Docker images to AKS.

   **Example Jenkinsfile**:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Checkout') {
               steps {
                   git 'https://github.com/my-repo/my-app.git'
               }
           }
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'mvn clean package'
               }
           }
           stage('Terraform Apply') {
               steps {
                   sh 'terraform init'
                   sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve'
               }
           }
           stage('Ansible Playbook') {
               steps {
                   sh 'ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml'
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy to AKS') {
               steps {
                   sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **SonarQube for Code Quality**
   - **Objective**: Ensure code quality by integrating static code analysis into the pipeline.
   - **Process**:
     - Integrate SonarQube with Jenkins to scan the code during the build process.
     - Jenkins triggers SonarQube to analyze the code and report on code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and code coverage.
     - Fail the build if the SonarQube quality gate is not passed.

   **Example SonarQube Integration in Jenkins**:
   ```groovy
   stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
       steps {
           script {
               def scannerHome = tool 'SonarQubeScanner'
               sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner \
                   -Dsonar.projectKey=my-app \
                   -Dsonar.sources=. \
                   -Dsonar.host.url=http://sonarqube:9000 \
                   -Dsonar.login=admin"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 6. **Nexus for Artifact Management**
   - **Objective**: Store and manage versioned artifacts such as Docker images, JARs, or libraries.
   - **Process**:
     - Integrate Nexus with Jenkins to store artifacts generated during the build phase (e.g., Docker images, JAR files).
     - Use Nexus to manage dependencies for the build process (e.g., retrieving libraries for Maven or npm builds).

   **Example Nexus Integration**:
   ```groovy
   stage('Publish Artifact to Nexus') {
       steps {
           sh 'mvn deploy'
       }
   }
   ```

### **End-to-End DevOps Flow Summary**
1. **Code Push**: Developers push code to GitHub or another VCS.
2. **Jenkins Pipeline**:
   - Jenkins triggers upon code push.
   - Terraform provisions Azure resources (like AKS).
   - Ansible configures the AKS environment or other VMs.
   - The application is built, tested with tools like Selenium or Jest, and packaged as a Docker image.
   - SonarQube analyzes the code for quality.
   - Nexus stores the built artifacts.
3. **Deployment to AKS**:
   - Docker images are deployed to AKS clusters via Helm or direct `kubectl`.
   - The app runs, and autoscaling/load balancing are managed by AKS.
4. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Azure Monitor, Prometheus, or Grafana for real-time monitoring.

This setup provides an automated, scalable, and secure pipeline for delivering applications in a corporate environment on Azure.
