What are the main advantages of using Azure Cosmos DB?

The primary advantages of Azure Cosmos DB are as follows:
Global distribution: Cosmos DB enables you to distribute data across multiple regions which ensures low latency and high availability for your applications.
Multi-model: It provides support for multiple data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column family. This allows you to use the right data model for your applicationâ€™s needs.
Scalability: Cosmos DB provides horizontal scaling for data which enables you to scale your databases to handle millions of requests per second.
Security: It provides built-in security features, including network isolation, encryption at rest, and role-based access control.
